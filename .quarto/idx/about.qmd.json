The instructors and TA are happy to help with assignments and clarifications. The first point of contact should be the TA, Kiseok Lee (`kiseoklee@uchicago.edu`); you can also email Stefano Allesina (`sallesina@uchicago.edu`) or Greg Dwyer (`gdwyer@uchicago.edu`) to set up a meeting. \n\nStudents are expected to work in accordance with the University Policy of Academic Integrity, which can be found [here](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/academic-integrity-student-conduct).\n\nStudents can collaborate, but graded homework should be completed by each student independently, and not copied from others or from online resources. Students can use online resources (e.g., StackOverflow, ChatGPT, or other LLMs) to help with coding, but should explicitly acknowledge sources whenever this is the case. Students should make sure that the code is correct, rather than blindly trusting these services.\n\nGrading: students should submit assigned homework by the beginning of the following class. Incomplete or late homework will be assigned zero points. The homework can be amended and resubmitted, as long as the original submission was complete, turned-in in time, and displayed solid effort. The grade is amended accordingly.\n\n### Mathematical background\n\nFollowing the material requires basic notions in calculus, linear algebra and dynamical systems. Students should be familiar with:\n\n- Functions, exponential function, logarithm\n- Limits\n- Derivatives and chain rule\n- Integration of functions in one and several variables\n\nThese concepts will be briefly reviewed in class, students who feel they will need to work on these at their own pace are encouraged to approach them before class:\n\n- Taylor series\n- Vectors, dot product, cross product\n- Matrix product, transpose, determinant, eigenvalue decomposition\n- Positive and negative definiteness of a matrix\n\nThese are good websites offering a brief review of these materials, and cheat sheets reporting the main formulas:\n\n- [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) covering calculus I, II and III as well as dynamical systems; the cheat sheets are excellent.\n\n- The legendary Linear Algebra class by [Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8), who has written excellent books on the subject, and taught legions at MIT.\n\n- Ziko Kolter has published a brief [review of linear algebra](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) concepts.\n\n- Linear algebra [in four pages](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/linear_algebra_in_4_pages.pdf) by  Ivan Savov.\n\n- Linear algebra [visualized](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) by 3Blue1Brown.\n\n- Steve Brunton's (U. Washington) YouTube channel contains extremely well-done lectures on dynamical systems; for example, here are reviews of [derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NhgElcA3K8), [Taylor series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebfOSDj4j3I), [simulating the logistic map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BvAkyuWhOI), [integrating ODEs in a computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-wxKgjBDnc).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThese lecture notes were prepared by Stefano Allesina (`sallesina@uchicago.edu`) for the graduate class *ECEV 42900, Theoretical Ecology*, taught at the University of Chicago in Winter Quarter 2024.
