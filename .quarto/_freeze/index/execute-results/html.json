We are going to explore:\n\n- Models for a single population\n- Models for two populations\n- Models for many populations\n- Models for disease dynamics\n\n## Computing\n\nThe GitHub associated with the lecture notes contains the code to generate the lectures and all the figures and simulations. Crucially, these depend on the following `R` packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # plotting, data organization\nlibrary(deSolve) # integrate differential equations\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Notation\n\n- We write $x(t)$ for the **density** of population $x$ at time $t$. In many cases, we will write simply $x$, as the dependency on time is always assumed. For discrete-time models, we write $x_t$ instead. Typically, $x(t)$ is measured in either $[\\text{mass}]/[\\text{area/volume}]$ or $[\\text{number of individuals}]/[\\text{area/volume}]$\n\n- The density of a population typically changes in time, and the change is modulated by several parameters. We use **Greek letters for scalars**, **lower-case Latin letters for vectors**, and **upper-case Latin letters for matrices**. \n\n- Other useful notation: \n  - $i$ is the imaginary unit, such that $i^2 = -1$\n  - $0_n$ is a vector of zeros of lenght $n$\n  - $1_n$ is a vector of ones of lenght $n$\n  - $I$ is the identity matrix (i.e., a matrix with $1_n$ on the diagonal, and zeros elsewhere)\n  - $D(a)$ is a diagonal matrix with vector $a$ on the diagonal",
