These lecture notes were prepared by Stefano Allesina (`sallesina@uchicago.edu`) for the graduate class *ECEV 42900, Theoretical Ecology*, taught at the University of Chicago in Winter Quarter 2024. The notes grew a set of notes from Sarah Cobey.

### Resources

These are good introductions to theoretical ecology:

- Case, [An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/an-illustrated-guide-to-theoretical-ecology-9780195085129?cc=us&lang=en&), 1999

- May and McLean, [Theoretical Ecology: Principles and Applications](https://academic.oup.com/book/42041), 2007

- Gotelli, [A primer of ecology](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-primer-of-ecology-9780878933181?cc=us&lang=en&), 2008


These are good resources for the mathematics of dynamical systems:


### Course policies

The ethos of the course is collaborative rather than competitive. The instructors are happy to help with assignments and clarifications. Email Stefano Allesina `sallesina@uchicago.edu` or Greg Dwyer `gdwyer@uchicago.edu` to meet. 

Students are expected to work in accordance with the University Policy of Academic Integrity, which can be found [here](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/academic-integrity-student-conduct).

Students can collaborate, but graded homework should be completed by each student, and not copied from others or from online resources. Students ca use online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT, or other LLMs) to help with coding, but should explicitly acknowledge sources whenever this is the case.

Late homework: TODO 


### Mathematical background

Following the material requires basic notions in calculus, linear algebra and dynamical systems. Here are a few essential concepts that students should be familiar with.

- Functions, exponential function, logarithm
- Limits
- Derivatives and chain rule
- Integration of functions in one and several variables
- Taylor series
- Vectors, dot product, cross product
- Matrix product, transpose, determinant eigenvalue decomposition
- Positive and negative definiteness of a matrix

These are good websites offering a brief review of these materials, and cheat sheets reporting the main formulas:

- [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) covering calculus I, II and III as well as dynamical systems; the cheat sheets are excellent.

- Steve Brunton's (U. Washington) YouTube channel has extremely well-done lectures on dynamical systems; for example, here are reviews of [derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NhgElcA3K8), [Taylor series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebfOSDj4j3I), [simulating the logistic map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BvAkyuWhOI), [integrating ODEs in a computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-wxKgjBDnc).
